This repository holds all of my work for Ph22 at Caltech. Each set's work
should all be contained within its own directory.

The .pdf file should be the final output for each set. My python setup comes
bundled in with emacs org mode. This is similar to what ipython notebooks
use. Code blocks themselves are embedded within the document and sent to an
existing ipython kernel process when evaluated. The blocks can be inputted
different headers depending on desired code language and data output
format. Org also includes LaTeX generation and automatically compiles/exports
code, latex, and images to pdf format. So, any coding I do happens inside these
.org files (or in some cases, outside .py scripts).
